# SHIPPED — What Exists in Production

**Purpose:** CTO reads this at session start. Single source of truth for "what code is live."
**Updated by:** CTO or agents after every session that adds/changes code.
**Rule:** If it's not here — CTO doesn't know it exists.

## Session 83 BATCH-V (2026-04-03) — Quality System + Missing Agents + Deep Research

| Item | Location | What it does | Status |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| `docs/QUALITY-SYSTEM.md` | New | Toyota TPS→software mapping, 15-item DoD, DORA 90-day roadmap, Langfuse plan, CrewAI architecture, missing infra priority list | ✅ NEW |
| `docs/ACCEPTANCE-CRITERIA-TEMPLATES.md` | New | Gherkin templates for all VOLAURA domains: assessment, AURA score, org search, auth/invite gate, email, Stripe | ✅ NEW |
| `memory/swarm/skills/acceptance-criteria-agent.md` | New | Writes Gherkin AC before coding. INVEST checker. Refuses to start without testable conditions. | ✅ NEW |
| `memory/swarm/skills/quality-assurance-agent.md` | New | Verifies 15-item DoD after coding. Binary PASS/FAIL per item. Blocks DONE if any item fails. | ✅ NEW |
| `memory/swarm/skills/dora-metrics-agent.md` | New | Tracks DORA metrics per batch. CFR, Lead Time, Deploy Freq. Appends to quality-metrics.md. | ✅ NEW |
| `memory/swarm/skills/langfuse-integration-agent.md` | New | LiteLLM proxy integration plan. Per-agent cost/quality monitoring. Migration path for all 6 edge functions. | ✅ NEW |
| `memory/context/mistakes.md` | Updated | CLASS 9 (no quality system) + CLASS 10 (process theater) added. Mistake #76: swarm found elaborate system without hard gates. Defect autopsy prescribed. | ✅ UPDATED |
| `memory/swarm/shared-context.md` | Updated | New agents added to routing table. Quality rule added. | ✅ UPDATED |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Updated | Tools table: Langfuse, AC agent, QA agent, DORA agent added as mandatory tools. | ✅ UPDATED |

**NotebookLM Research (notebook 888d43e4):** 9 sources loaded. 6 deep questions answered on: Toyota TPS→software, DORA Elite 90-day roadmap, INVEST+Gherkin AC, 15-item DoD, CrewAI architecture, Langfuse integration.

**Swarm Retrospective (Groq Llama-3.3-70b):**
- Finding 1: New quality system is "process-as-performance" — no hard gates, manual invocation means 0 invocations (proven by history)
- Finding 2: Root cause unaddressed — CTO starts coding before writing what "done" looks like. New agents don't change this habit.
- Finding 3: Cut DoD to 3 items (most common defect types). Implement HARD GATE (pre-commit hook). Do defect autopsy on 73 bugs FIRST.
- New Mistake #76 + CLASS 10 (process theater) documented.

**Pending CEO / CTO actions (from research → implementation):**
1. **DEFECT AUTOPSY** — Categorize all 73 historical bugs by type. Find the 3 most common. Build only those 3 into hard gates. (1 day effort, highest leverage)
2. **LANGFUSE** — Sign up at cloud.langfuse.com (free). Set LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY + LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY on Railway. Wire via LiteLLM. (2 hour effort)
3. **HARD AC GATE** — Add pre-batch check: batch cannot proceed without AC.md file. (30 min effort)
4. **3-ITEM DOD** — From defect autopsy results, replace 15-item DoD with enforced 3 items. (after autopsy)

## Session 82 BATCH-R (2026-04-03) — Verification link + journey audit

| Item | What it does | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Public verification endpoint | GET /api/assessment/verify/{session_id} — no auth, shows score+badge+competency to LinkedIn viewers | Created |
| Verification page | /u/{username}/verify/{sessionId} — beautiful card showing verified score, badge tier, assessment method | Created |
| PublicVerificationOut schema | Pydantic model for public-safe verification data | Created |
| Tribe matching audit | Algorithm verified COMPLETE (286 LOC) — audit agent false positive corrected | Confirmed |
| 7 user journey audit | Full E2E audit: 4 working, 3 gated (awaiting config activation) | Documented |

---

## Session 83 BATCH-U (2026-04-02) — Transactional email + demo seed + context refresh

| Code | Location | What it does | Status |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| `email.py` | `apps/api/app/services/email.py` | `send_aura_ready_email()` — Resend API. Gold-styled HTML email: AURA score, badge tier, crystals, CTA → `/assessment`. Never raises. Kill switch: `EMAIL_ENABLED` (default False). | ✅ NEW |
| `email_enabled` + `resend_api_key` | `apps/api/app/config.py` | Kill switch fields. Activate: RESEND_API_KEY + EMAIL_ENABLED=true on Railway + verify noreply@volaura.app in Resend. | ✅ NEW |
| Email hook in `complete_assessment()` | `apps/api/app/routers/assessment.py` | After analytics event: fetches user email + badge_tier + display_name → fire-and-forget `send_aura_ready_email()`. | ✅ WIRED |
| `seed_demo_volunteer.py` | `scripts/seed_demo_volunteer.py` | One-shot script: creates demo@volaura.app (UUID 00000000-...-0001), Gold badge 82/100 across 3 competencies, visible_to_orgs=True. Run once: `python scripts/seed_demo_volunteer.py`. | ✅ NEW |
| shared-context.md refresh | `memory/swarm/shared-context.md` | Synced from 2026-03-30 → 2026-04-02. BATCH-R/S/T/U logged. CEO actions listed. Current sprint goal updated. | ✅ UPDATED |

**Swarm retrospective findings (applied this batch):**
- External models (Llama 405B + Groq 70B): CTO building code while Phase 0 (first real user) stays CEO-blocked. Email + demo seed directly serve Phase 0 unblock.
- DeepSeek R1 unavailable (CUDA OOM on NVIDIA NIM) — fell back to Groq. Documented.

**CEO actions to activate email:**
1. Create Resend account → resend.com → verify `noreply@volaura.app` domain
2. `RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxx` → set on Railway
3. `EMAIL_ENABLED=true` → set on Railway

**CEO action to activate demo:**
1. `python scripts/seed_demo_volunteer.py` (runs against Railway DB via env vars)

## Session 83 BATCH-T (2026-04-02) — Test mock fix

| Code | Location | What it does | Status |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| `test_tribes.py` mock fix | `apps/api/tests/test_tribes.py` | Added `tribe_matching_pool` table to `make_user_db_not_in_tribe()` mock with `AsyncMock` for both `upsert().execute()` and `select().eq().maybe_single().execute()`. Fixes `TypeError: MagicMock can't be awaited` in join-pool test. | ✅ Fixed |

**Test count after:** 742 passing, 1 pre-existing failure (`test_no_matches_updates_last_checked` in test_match_checker.py)

---

## Session 83 BATCH-S (2026-04-02) — Analytics events + Telegram hardening

| Code | Location | What it does | Status |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| `answer_submitted` event | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/assessment/[sessionId]/page.tsx` | Fires on every answer submission: competency_slug, question_id, question_type, answer_number, response_time_ms. Uses `useTrackEvent` hook. | ✅ Wired |
| `assessment_completed_view` event | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/assessment/[sessionId]/complete/page.tsx` | Fires after fetchResults succeeds: competency_slug, competency_score, questions_answered, aura_updated, has_gaming_flags, crystals_earned. | ✅ Wired |
| Telegram webhook hard-fail | `apps/api/app/config.py` → `assert_production_ready()` | `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` missing in production now raises RuntimeError (blocks deployment). Was WARNING only — endpoint accepted all POSTs without signature verification. | ✅ Fixed |

**Swarm finding applied:** `currentQuestion.question_type` (not `.type`) — TS field name corrected before commit.

---

## Session 83 BATCH-R (2026-04-02) — Security + flow fixes (commit 9d17a58)

| Code | Location | What it does | Status |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| `open_signup` default → `False` | `apps/api/app/config.py` | Was `True` — anyone could register if `OPEN_SIGNUP` Railway env var not set. Now closed by default; must explicitly set `OPEN_SIGNUP=true` on Railway to open beta. | ✅ Fixed |
| LLM daily cap fail-closed | `apps/api/app/routers/assessment.py` | DB exception during cap check now sets `_force_degraded = True` (keyword fallback). Was fail-open — exception silently bypassed RISK-013, unlimited paid LLM calls possible. | ✅ Fixed |
| 409 SESSION_IN_PROGRESS resume | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/assessment/page.tsx` | 409 response now reads `session_id` from body and redirects to existing session. Was showing generic error, stranding users mid-assessment. | ✅ Fixed |
| Org routing fix | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/onboarding/page.tsx` | `accountType === "organization"` now routes to `/my-organization`. Was routing all account types to `/assessment`. | ✅ Fixed |
| `500-HOUR-PLAN.md` | `docs/500-HOUR-PLAN.md` | 8-phase execution plan. Phase 0 (10h, first real user) gates all other phases. CEO vs CTO ownership separated. | ✅ Created |

**Phase 2 cross-critique result:** Security audit misclassified 2/4 P0s. Supabase anon key = by design public (no fix). `config.toml` `enable_confirmations=false` = local dev only (no fix).

| analytics-retention workflow | `.github/workflows/analytics-retention.yml` | Monthly GDPR DELETE — rows older than 390 days. Runs 1st of month 03:00 UTC. Dry-run mode. Needs GitHub secrets: SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID + SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY | ✅ Created (secrets needed) |
| `analytics.py` service | `apps/api/app/services/analytics.py` | `track_event()` — fire-and-forget, never raises, uses service-role db | ✅ Created |
| `assessment_completed` event | `apps/api/app/routers/assessment.py` line 759 | Fires after tribe streak hook on every completed assessment. Properties: slug, score, q_count, stop_reason, aura_updated, crystals_earned, gaming_flags | ✅ Wired |
| Mistake #68 | `memory/context/mistakes.md` | Same-model swarm = monologue (CLASS 3, 13th instance) | ✅ Saved |
| Mistake #69 | `memory/context/mistakes.md` | Findings declared not persisted (CLASS 2, 9th instance) | ✅ Saved |
| Step 5.4 | `docs/TASK-PROTOCOL.md` | LLM PROVIDER CHECK — fires before every swarm ≥3 agents | ✅ Saved |

**P0.3 pgvector HNSW:** Already exists — `idx_volunteer_embeddings_hnsw` (m=16, ef=64). No action needed.

## Session 81 (2026-04-02) — Growth Trajectory Widget + Milestone Animation (D.2-A + D.2-B)

| Code | Location | What it does | Status |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Growth Trajectory Widget | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/assessment/[sessionId]/complete/page.tsx` | Animated progress bar showing "X pts to [next tier]". Uses `aura.total_score` + tier thresholds. Framer Motion bar animates from 0 to pct on reveal (delay 0.75s). Shows Platinum max state. No new backend. | ✅ NEW |
| Milestone Banner | Same file | Gold/Platinum celebration banner — shows when `aura_updated && badge_tier in [gold,platinum]`. Gradient background (yellow/cyan), spring animation. Appears between Badge Reveal and Stats Row. | ✅ NEW |
| i18n growth keys EN | `apps/web/src/locales/en/common.json` | `progressToNextTier`, `tierMaxReached`, `milestonePlatinum`, `milestoneGold`, `milestoneDiscoverable` | ✅ NEW |
| i18n growth keys AZ | `apps/web/src/locales/az/common.json` | AZ translations for all 5 growth keys | ✅ NEW |
| Board heavy run script | `board_heavy_run.py` (project root) | nemotron-ultra-253b × 2 + deepseek-r1 on growth topic. Both Board agents voted: Tribe Streaks (Strategic Dir) + Collective AURA Ladders (CPO). BOTH killed AURA Leaderboard unanimously. | ✅ UTILITY |
| board-heavy-results.json | `memory/swarm/board-heavy-results.json` | Raw Board analysis results from heavy models | ✅ ARTIFACT |

**Board unanimous findings (both nemotron-ultra-253b agents):**
- KILL: AURA Score Leaderboard — "direct cultural mismatch, anxiety from public rankings will suppress usage in AZ/CIS"
- NEW RISK: Anti-harassment safeguards needed for Tribe formation (nobody else mentioned this)
- NEW RISK: Exclusionary cliques if group membership is static (Collective AURA Ladders)

## Session 80 (2026-04-01) — CIS-001 Fix + Profile View Infra

| Code | Location | What it does | Status |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Discovery: Sprint D.1 already shipped | `apps/api/app/routers/profiles.py` + `apps/web/src/components/profile/profile-view-tracker.tsx` + `apps/api/tests/test_profile_view.py` | `POST /api/profiles/{username}/view` endpoint existed, frontend ProfileViewTracker existed, 6 tests existed. Session confirmed these are live — not re-implemented. | ✅ CONFIRMED |
| `notify_profile_viewed()` | `apps/api/app/services/notification_service.py` | New helper function: throttled `org_view` notification emit. Checks 24h window via partial index. Never raises. Returns bool (sent/throttled). Uses `org_id` as reference_id. | ✅ NEW |
| Org view throttle index | `supabase/migrations/20260401180000_profile_view_notification_index.sql` | Partial index on `notifications(user_id, reference_id, created_at) WHERE type='org_view'`. Serves the 24h dedup query in `record_profile_view` endpoint. Prevents seq scan as notifications table grows. | ✅ NEW |
| Achievement level utility | `apps/web/src/lib/utils/achievement-level.ts` | `getAchievementLevelKey(percentileRank)` — maps 0-100 percentile to i18n key (Expert/Advanced/Proficient/Growing/Building/Starting). CIS-001 fix. | ✅ NEW |
| i18n achievement keys | `apps/web/src/locales/en/common.json` + `az/common.json` | `profile.achievementLabel` + 6 tier keys (achievementExpert → achievementStarting). AZ: Ekspert/Peşəkar/Bilikli/İnkişaf Edir/Hazırlanır/Başlanır. | ✅ UPDATED |
| CIS-001 fix: public profile | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(public)/u/[username]/page.tsx` | Replaced `t("profile.topPercent", ...)` with `t(getAchievementLevelKey(percentileRank))`. "Top 5%" → "Expert". Non-competitive framing for AZ/CIS users. | ✅ UPDATED |
| CIS-001 fix: assessment complete | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/assessment/[sessionId]/complete/page.tsx` | Achievement level replaces percentile stat box display. Label changes from "percentile" to `profile.achievementLabel`. Share text keeps `topPercent` (opt-in competitive context). | ✅ UPDATED |

## Session 79 (2026-04-01) — BATCH C: Sprint 8 Tests + Realtime Notifications

| Code | Location | What it does | Status |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Sprint 8 Tests | `apps/api/tests/test_saved_searches.py` | 13 tests: happy path (create/list/delete/update), privilege escalation (org A ≠ org B), validation (cap/dupe/badge_tier/UUID/empty), match checker service (no searches, DB error, circuit breaker). | ✅ NEW |
| Realtime Notifications Hook | `apps/web/src/hooks/queries/use-notifications.ts` | `useRealtimeNotifications(userId)` — Supabase Realtime subscription to `notifications` table INSERT. On INSERT → invalidates unread count + list queries instantly. Falls back silently. Cleans up on unmount. | ✅ UPDATED |
| Realtime Provider | `apps/web/src/components/layout/realtime-notifications.tsx` | `RealtimeNotificationsProvider` — client component. Reads userId from auth session, calls `useRealtimeNotifications()`. Renders nothing (side-effect only). | ✅ NEW |
| Dashboard Layout | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` | Added `<RealtimeNotificationsProvider />` — persists subscription across all dashboard pages. | ✅ UPDATED |
| DSP Decision logged | `memory/swarm/agent-feedback-log.md` | Explicit defer: FastAPI WebSocket / ANUS = do NOT propose before 2026-07-01 or 500 active users. Alternative: Supabase Realtime (implemented). Stops 5+ convergent proposals from recurring. | ✅ UPDATED |

| Code | Location | What it does | Status |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Cross-Product Bridge | `apps/api/app/services/cross_product_bridge.py` | Fire-and-forget Volaura→MindShift event push. 3 public async functions: `push_crystal_earned()`, `push_skill_verified()`, `push_xp_earned()`. Circuit breaker: 3 failures/5min → 60s silence. httpx async client, 3s connect / 8s read timeouts. Never raises. `reset_circuit_breaker()` for tests. | ✅ NEW |
| rewards.py updated | `apps/api/app/services/assessment/rewards.py` | Added `user_jwt: str \| None = None` param. After persisting local events, calls `push_crystal_earned()` + `push_skill_verified()` on the bridge (fire-and-forget). | ✅ UPDATED |

## Session 77 (2026-03-31) — BATCH-S: Vertex LLM + Invite UX + Smoke Test + Sprint 5 Q-Bank + S-05 generate:api

| Code | Location | What it does | Status |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| S-01: Startup guard ALL envs | `apps/api/app/config.py` → `assert_production_ready()` | RISK-011 check (old Supabase URL) now fires BEFORE `if app_env != "production": return` — was silently bypassed on staging/dev. | ✅ S-01 |
| S-02: supabase_project_ref in /health | `apps/api/app/routers/health.py` | `HealthResponse` gains `supabase_project_ref: str`. CEO can `curl /health` to verify Railway points to correct DB (`dwdgzfusjsobnixgyzjk`). `_extract_project_ref()` parses URL. `llm_ok` now checks Gemini OR Vertex key. | ✅ S-02 |
| S-03+S-08: Invite pre-fill + flicker fix | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(auth)/signup/page.tsx` | `inviteCode` state initialized from `searchParams.get("invite")`. `openSignup` state initialized to `false` when `?invite=` present (avoids 200-400ms async fetch flicker). | ✅ S-03+S-08 |
| S-04: Vertex + Groq LLM chain | `apps/api/app/services/llm.py` | Full rewrite. Singleton clients (`_vertex_client`, `_gemini_client`). `reset_llm_clients()` for test teardown. Fallback chain: Vertex Express → Gemini → Groq → OpenAI. `_call_vertex()`: `genai.Client(vertexai=True, api_key=...)`. `_call_groq()`: `AsyncGroq`, `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`. `generate_embedding` tries Vertex first. | ✅ S-04 |
| S-04: vertex_api_key in config | `apps/api/app/config.py` | `vertex_api_key: str = ""` added with Vertex Express comment. `VERTEX_API_KEY=AQ.Ab8...` in `.env`. | ✅ S-04 |
| S-05: pnpm generate:api | `apps/web/src/lib/api/generated/` | Ran `pnpm generate:api` from live FastAPI /openapi.json. New endpoints added: `signupStatusApiAuthSignupStatusGet` (GET /api/auth/signup-status), `validateInviteApiAuthValidateInvitePost` (POST /api/auth/validate-invite). Signup page updated to use type-safe `SignupStatusResponse` + `ValidateInviteResponse` imports. **Unblocks CEO E2E walk.** | ✅ S-05 |
| S-07: Invalid invite Telegram CTA | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(public)/invite/page.tsx` | Invalid code state: Telegram primary CTA (`t.me/yusifganbarov`, #2AABEE button), LinkedIn secondary, manual code entry link. 4 new i18n keys. `invite.invalidBody` updated to mention Telegram. | ✅ S-07 |
| S-09: Production smoke test | `scripts/prod_smoke_test.py` | NEW. Hits real Railway URL. Steps: health→supabase_project_ref, signup-status, validate-invite, auth gate (401), public profile, leaderboard. Exit code 1 on failure. Mistake #52 prevention. | ✅ S-09 |
| S-10: Sprint 5 question bank | `scripts/question-evolution/sprint-5/*.json` | 7 profession JSON files (70 questions total). All pass: irt_a≥1.2 ✅, hard irt_b 1.2-2.0 ✅, evaluation_rubric on all open_ended ✅, empathy_safeguarding≥2 per set ✅. | ✅ S-10 |

## Session 76 continued (2026-03-30) — BATCH-Q fixes: 661/661 tests — ALL GREEN

| Code | Location | What it does | Status |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Fix test_org_b2b.py mock chain | `apps/api/tests/test_org_b2b.py` → `_build_dashboard_mock` + `_build_volunteers_mock` | Added `t.limit.return_value = t` to both `assessment_sessions` mock branches. SEC-Q4 added `.limit()` caps to org queries, breaking the chainable mock. 4 tests were failing → all 7 passing. | ✅ |
| Fix test_smoke_assessment.py pre-existing failure | `apps/api/tests/test_smoke_assessment.py` → `test_submit_open_ended_uses_keyword_fallback` | Root cause: module-level `_COMPETENCY_SLUG_CACHE` warm from previous tests shifted iterator; ALSO missed daily LLM cap check DB call (line 462 in assessment.py) in mock sequence. Fix: `clear_question_cache()` at test start + added `[]` response for cap check at position 2 in mock list. 1 pre-existing failure → now passing. | ✅ |
| New Supabase project keys | `apps/api/.env`, `apps/web/.env.local`, `apps/api/app/config.py` | New paid project `dwdgzfusjsobnixgyzjk` (Sydney). SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY all updated. RISK-011 startup guard blocks boot if old project URL still present. | ✅ |
| SEC-Q2: Percentile visibility filter | `apps/api/app/routers/profiles.py` → `get_public_profile` | Both COUNT queries for percentile_rank now filter `.eq("visibility", "public")`. Previously counted private/badge_only scores → leaked aggregate platform stats. | ✅ SEC-Q2 |
| SEC-Q2: Username enumeration rate | `apps/api/app/routers/profiles.py` → `get_public_profile` | Rate limit changed from `RATE_DEFAULT` (60/min) to `RATE_DISCOVERY` (10/min). Prevents brute-force username enumeration. | ✅ SEC-Q2 |
| SEC-Q3: beta-funnel org-only guard | `apps/api/app/routers/stats.py` → `get_beta_funnel_stats` | Volunteers get 403 FORBIDDEN. Previously all authenticated users could access platform health metrics (completion rates, abandonment rates, user counts). | ✅ SEC-Q3 |
| SEC-Q4/BUG-005: ORM cap on org queries | `apps/api/app/routers/organizations.py` → `get_org_dashboard` + `list_org_volunteers` | `.limit(2000)` cap on dashboard sessions, `.limit(10_000)` on volunteer list. Both log WARNING at cap. Prevents OOM at 10k users. | ✅ SEC-Q4 |
| SEC-Q5: PII removed from logs | `apps/api/app/main.py`, `apps/api/app/routers/subscription.py`, `apps/api/app/routers/organizations.py` | 3 log statements fixed: `str(e)` → `type(e).__name__` in Stripe log; `query=payload.query[:50]` → `query_len=len(payload.query)` in search log; global exception handler truncated to `[:120]`. | ✅ SEC-Q5 |
| Migrations to new project | `supabase/migrations/` → Supabase project `dwdgzfusjsobnixgyzjk` | Agent applying all 57 migrations via Supabase MCP. In progress (~26/57 at last check). | 🔄 IN PROGRESS |

| SEC-ANSWER-01: Subscription gate on /answer | `apps/api/app/routers/assessment.py` → `submit_answer` | Fail-closed paywall check on POST /assessment/answer when `payment_enabled=True`. Returns 402 SUBSCRIPTION_REQUIRED for expired/cancelled status. Mirrors /start gate pattern. | ✅ SEC-ANSWER-01 |
| P0 paywall tests | `apps/api/tests/test_paywall_enforcement.py` | 2 new tests: `test_submit_answer_blocked_when_expired` + `test_submit_answer_blocked_when_cancelled`. Both verify 402 response. Total: 8/8 passing. | ✅ |
| ISSUE-Q4: Celebration pulse ring | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/assessment/[sessionId]/complete/page.tsx` | Framer Motion pulse ring on badge circle for scores ≥75. Respects `useReducedMotion()` — ring suppressed for accessibility. `aria-hidden="true"`. | ✅ ISSUE-Q4a |
| ISSUE-Q4: Next-action cards | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/assessment/[sessionId]/complete/page.tsx` + EN/AZ locales | Replaced text-only bullets with 2 tappable nav cards: "Assess more competencies" → /assessment; "See your AURA score" → /aura. WCAG focus-visible ring. Score-contextual tip lines. | ✅ ISSUE-Q4b |
| ISSUE-AU3: NextStepCard on AURA page | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/aura/page.tsx` + EN/AZ locales | 2 nav cards at bottom of AURA page: "Assess another competency" + "Leaderboard". Animate in with `revealed` state (0.75s delay). | ✅ ISSUE-AU3 |
| i18n: complete page keys | `apps/web/src/locales/en/common.json` + `apps/web/src/locales/az/common.json` | New keys: `nextStepAssess`, `nextStepAssessDesc`, `nextStepAura`, `nextStepAuraDesc`, `nextStepAuraScore`, `tipImprove`, `tipExcellent`. AZ uses formal Siz, collective framing. | ✅ |
| i18n: AURA page keys | `apps/web/src/locales/en/common.json` + `apps/web/src/locales/az/common.json` | New keys: `aura.nextSteps`, `aura.nextStepAssess`, `aura.nextStepAssessDesc`, `aura.nextStepLeaderboard`, `aura.nextStepLeaderboardDesc`. | ✅ |
| test_beta_user_journey.py (E2E chain) | `apps/api/tests/test_beta_user_journey.py` | 7 integrated E2E tests covering full beta user path: create profile → start assessment → submit answer → complete → AURA score → public profile → journey smoke. All 7 passing. Key contracts validated: db_admin for session UPDATE, raw_score not in response (CRIT-03), PublicProfileResponse schema. | ✅ QA-E2E |

## Session 76 continued (2026-03-30) — BATCH-O: Cultural Intelligence + Behavioral UX + Accessibility Polish — 648/649 tests passing

| Code | Location | What it does | Status |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| CI-ON1: Formal "Siz" throughout onboarding | `apps/web/src/locales/az/common.json` — onboarding section | 14 instances of informal `sən` replaced with formal `Siz` across all onboarding copy. AZ cultural standard: formal address for professional platform. | ✅ CI-ON1 |
| CI-ON2: ISO trust context | `apps/web/src/locales/az/common.json` → `onboarding.next2` | Added "ISO 10667-2 standartına uyğun" framing. Replaces "AI" with trust signal recognized in AZ market. | ✅ CI-ON2 |
| CI-ON3: Collective non-competitive reframe | `apps/web/src/locales/az/common.json` + `apps/web/src/locales/en/common.json` | `hiddenStrengthDesc`, `feature3Desc`, `shareText`, `leaderboard.emptyTitle/emptyDesc`, `nav.leaderboard`, `sharePrompt.title/desc` reframed from competitive to collective achievement framing. | ✅ CI-ON3 |
| CI-ON4: nav.leaderboard rename | `apps/web/src/locales/az/common.json` | "Liderlər Lövhəsi" (competitive) → "Ən Yaxşılar" (aspirational). Reduces competitive anxiety in collective culture. | ✅ CI-ON4 |
| CI-ON5: shareText formal + inclusive | `apps/web/src/locales/az/common.json` | "Sən də sına" → "Siz də yoxlayın". Formal address + active verb = professional tone. | ✅ CI-ON5 |
| CI-ON6: topPercent collective framing | `apps/web/src/locales/az/common.json` → `profile.topPercent` | "Ən yaxşı {{percent}}%" → "Ən yaxşıların {{percent}}% arasında". Membership framing not ranking. | ✅ CI-ON6 |
| CI-ON7: AI → alqoritm trust signal | `apps/web/src/locales/az/common.json` → `assessment.stillWorking` | "AI cavabınızı yoxlayır" → "qiymətləndirmə alqoritmi cavabınızı analiz edir". "AI" raises suspicion; "alqoritm" reads as systematic/fair. | ✅ CI-ON7 |
| CI-PUB1: 3 hardcoded EN strings on public profile | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(public)/u/[username]/page.tsx` + both locales | `getAuraScore`, `foundingMember`, `founding1000`, `getStarted` — all hardcoded English replaced with `t()` calls. Critical: public profile is viral share target — was always showing EN to AZ users. | ✅ CI-PUB1 |
| BATCH-O A1: Pre-select communication | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/assessment/page.tsx` | Default selection `new Set(["communication"])` when no `?competency=` param. Eliminates 8-way decision paralysis on first load. | ✅ BATCH-O A1 |
| BATCH-O A3: Cooldown 429 with minutes | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/assessment/page.tsx` + both locales | 429 response now reads `Retry-After` header, shows exact wait time: `t("assessment.cooldownError", { minutes: waitMin })`. Turns dead 429 into re-engagement message. `cooldownError` key added to both locales. | ✅ BATCH-O A3 |
| BATCH-O ON1: Pre-select onboarding competency | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/onboarding/page.tsx` | `selectedCompetency` state defaults to `"communication"`. Reduces first-time user decision burden. | ✅ BATCH-O ON1 |
| BATCH-O ON3: positive visible_to_orgs | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/onboarding/page.tsx` + both locales | Replaced checkbox with positive confirmation text: "✓ Profiliniz təşkilatlara görünəcək". Checkbox was causing voluntary opt-outs before users understood the value. `visibleToOrgsInfo` key added. | ✅ BATCH-O ON3 |
| BATCH-O Q-counter cap | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/assessment/[sessionId]/page.tsx` | `Math.min(answeredCount + 1, ESTIMATED_QUESTIONS)` — counter never shows "9 of 8". Off-by-one UX confusion fixed. | ✅ BATCH-O Q |
| BATCH-O SHARE: navigator.share() i18n | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/assessment/[sessionId]/complete/page.tsx` + both locales | `shareBody`, `shareBodyLow`, `shareTitle`, `shareTitleLow` keys added to both locales. Was hardcoded English template literals — every share from Baku users went to Telegram in English. Critical viral path fix. | ✅ BATCH-O SHARE |
| BATCH-O SHARE2: topPercent on complete page | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/assessment/[sessionId]/complete/page.tsx` | Hardcoded "top X%" replaced with `t("profile.topPercent", { percent })`. | ✅ BATCH-O SHARE2 |
| BATCH-O AURA1: useReducedMotion | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/aura/page.tsx` | Counter animation duration: `prefersReducedMotion ? 0 : 2000`. Share modal timer: 3000 → 5000ms. WCAG 2.2 motion preference compliance. | ✅ BATCH-O AURA1 |
| BATCH-O AURA2: skeleton loading state | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/aura/page.tsx` | Full skeleton with animated pulse cards replaces bare spinner. Removed unused `Loader2` import. | ✅ BATCH-O AURA2 |
| BATCH-O AURA3: Continue routes to active session | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/aura/page.tsx` | Added `useAssessmentStore` → reads `sessionId`. Continue button: `/${locale}/assessment/${activeSessionId}` when session active, else `/assessment`. Prevents routing to selection screen mid-assessment. | ✅ BATCH-O AURA3 |
| BATCH-O DASH1: useReducedMotion on dashboard | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` | `pageVariantsReduced` + `sectionVariantsReduced` — disables translate/opacity animation for reduced-motion users. | ✅ BATCH-O DASH1 |
| BATCH-O DASH2: 44px dismiss buttons | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` | Trial/share banner dismiss buttons: `size-5` → `size-11` (44px WCAG tap target). Color: `opacity-60` → `text-amber-600/700` for visibility. | ✅ BATCH-O DASH2 |
| BATCH-O DASH3: share prompt gate | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` | Share prompt gated: `showSharePrompt = hasScore && !sharePromptDismissed && !!profile?.username && !(!bannerDismissed && (isTrial \|\| isExpired))`. Prevents two competing banners. | ✅ BATCH-O DASH3 |
| BATCH-O WCAG: sr-only table in radar chart | `apps/web/src/components/aura/radar-chart.tsx` + both locales | Added `<table className="sr-only">` with competency/score data. SVG `aria-hidden="true"`. Screen readers now get full chart data. `aura.competency` + `aura.score` keys added. | ✅ BATCH-O WCAG |

## Session 76 continued (2026-03-30) — BATCH-N: Growth + Safety Wave — 648/649 tests passing

| Code | Location | What it does | Status |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| RISK-N01: Telegram hard fail | `apps/api/app/config.py` → `assert_production_ready()` | Hard-errors if `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` empty in prod — bot can't be silently dead at launch. | ✅ RISK-N01 |
| RISK-N02: Stripe hard fail | `apps/api/app/config.py` → `assert_production_ready()` | Hard-errors if `PAYMENT_ENABLED=True` + `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` empty — blocks unsigned webhook spoofing before payments activate. | ✅ RISK-N02 |
| GROW-N01: Silver share copy | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/assessment/[sessionId]/complete/page.tsx` + EN/AZ locales | Silver tier (60-74) now sees "Building momentum — share your progress and challenge a peer" instead of "You're in the top tier" (factually wrong for Silver). | ✅ GROW-N01 |
| GROW-M02: Cooldown notification | `apps/api/app/routers/assessment.py` + EN/AZ locales | Fire-and-forget `notify()` call when cooldown is hit — tells user exactly how many minutes until retake is ready. Turns dead-end 429 into re-engagement nudge. | ✅ GROW-M02 |
| PROD-M03: Share buttons mobile | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/assessment/[sessionId]/complete/page.tsx` | Both share buttons: `w-full sm:w-auto min-h-[44px]` — full-width on mobile, 44px tap targets, no overflow at 375px. | ✅ PROD-M03 |
| GROW-M03: Public profile peer benchmark | `apps/api/app/schemas/profile.py`, `apps/api/app/routers/profiles.py`, `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(public)/u/[username]/page.tsx`, new `apps/web/src/components/profile/challenge-button.tsx`, EN/AZ locales | `percentile_rank` added to PublicProfileResponse. Profile shows "Top X%" stat. "Challenge a peer" button copies `volaura.app/?ref=[username]` to clipboard. 3 i18n keys added. | ✅ GROW-M03 |
| ARCH-M03: pending_aura_sync banner | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/assessment/[sessionId]/complete/page.tsx` + EN/AZ locales | Amber banner shows when `result.aura_updated === false` — "Your AURA score is being recalculated — check back in a few minutes." Invisible on happy path. | ✅ ARCH-M03 |

## Session 76 continued (2026-03-30) — BATCH-M: Launch Readiness Wave — 648/649 tests passing

| Code | Location | What it does | Status |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| RISK-M01: LLM cost spiral guard | `apps/api/app/config.py` → `assert_production_ready()` | Hard error if Gemini configured without Groq on Railway. Prevents $240/day cost spiral when Gemini rate-limits and OpenAI paid fallback activates. | ✅ RISK-M01 |
| ARCH-M02: Leaderboard period index | `supabase/migrations/20260330180000_add_leaderboard_period_index.sql` | Composite index `(visibility, last_updated DESC, total_score DESC)` on aura_scores. Applied to prod via MCP. Leaderboard period queries (weekly/monthly) no longer full-scan. | ✅ ARCH-M02 |
| QA-M01: Leaderboard auth tests | `apps/api/tests/test_new_endpoints.py` → `TestLeaderboard` | 2 tests: `is_current_user=True` when auth token matches entry, `is_current_user=False` for all when no auth. Covers LEADERBOARD-01 implementation. | ✅ QA-M01 |
| GROW-M01: Silver share box | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/assessment/[sessionId]/complete/page.tsx` | Share box now shown for score ≥60 (Silver), not ≥75 (Gold). Ghost button only for <60. Wider share funnel. | ✅ GROW-M01 |
| PROD-M01: Answer saved indicator | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/assessment/[sessionId]/page.tsx` | 600ms "Saved ✓" state on submit button after successful answer save. `answerSaved` state + `isMounted` guard. EN+AZ keys added. | ✅ PROD-M01 |
| QA-M02: total_count tests | `apps/api/tests/test_new_endpoints.py` → `TestLeaderboardTotalCount` | 2 tests: (1) `total_count=200` when DB has 200 rows but page limit=50. (2) graceful fallback to `len(entries)` when count query raises. Both passing. | ✅ QA-M02 |
| QA-M03: Verification endpoint tests | `apps/api/tests/test_new_endpoints.py` → `TestVerificationEndpoint` | 5 tests: happy path 201, token_used→409, expired→410, not_found→404, AURA blend math (rating=4 + existing=75 → blended=77.0). All passing. | ✅ QA-M03 |

## Session 76 continued (2026-03-30) — BATCH-L: Security + UX + Leaderboard — 638/640 tests passing

| Code | Location | What it does | Status |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| SEC-03: display_name anonymization | `apps/api/app/routers/profiles.py` | Added `_anonymize_name()` at module level. Applied in `list_public_volunteers` loop — `display_name=_anonymize_name(row.get("display_name"))`. Closes org→discovery cross-reference deanonymization attack. | ✅ SEC-03 |
| OptionalCurrentUserId dep | `apps/api/app/deps.py` | New `get_optional_user_id()` async function + `OptionalCurrentUserId` Annotated type alias. Returns `str | None` — user id if valid JWT present, None otherwise. Used for public-but-personalizable endpoints. | ✅ LEADERBOARD-01 |
| Leaderboard is_current_user | `apps/api/app/routers/leaderboard.py` | Added `user_id: OptionalCurrentUserId` to `get_leaderboard()`. `is_current_user=bool(user_id and volunteer_id and user_id == volunteer_id)` in entry loop. Was always False. | ✅ LEADERBOARD-01 |
| Leaderboard total_count fix | `apps/api/app/routers/leaderboard.py` | Added post-loop count query with try/except fallback. `total_count` now reflects full DB count, not `len(entries)` (page size). Falls back gracefully if count query fails. | ✅ LEADERBOARD-02 |
| I18N-01: Missing locale keys | `apps/web/src/locales/en/common.json`, `apps/web/src/locales/az/common.json` | Added `aura.sharePromptTitle`, `aura.sharePromptBody`, `aura.coach.title`, `common.dismiss`. Both EN and AZ. Fixes AZ users seeing English on share modal and coach section. | ✅ I18N-01 |
| AURA-02: Zero-state split | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/aura/page.tsx` | Split `if (!aura \|\| aura.total_score == null)` into two branches: `!aura` = "never started" (start button), `aura.total_score == null` = "in progress" (Clock icon + continue button). Added `Clock` import from lucide-react. | ✅ AURA-02 |
| I18N: assessmentInProgress keys | `apps/web/src/locales/en/common.json`, `apps/web/src/locales/az/common.json` | Added `aura.assessmentInProgress` and `aura.assessmentInProgressDesc` to both locales. Used by AURA-02 in-progress state. | ✅ AURA-02 |

## Session 76 continued (2026-03-30) — BATCH-K: Launch Readiness Sprint — 632/633 tests passing

| Code | Location | What it does | Status |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Remove dead Subscribe CTA | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` | Replaced disabled "Subscribe" button with static "coming soon" text. Removed subscribeButton i18n key from both locales. | ✅ K-01 |
| AuraExplanationResponse schema | `apps/api/app/schemas/aura.py`, `apps/api/app/routers/aura.py` | Added AuraEvaluationItem, AuraCompetencyExplanation, AuraExplanationResponse Pydantic v2 schemas. response_model now on /aura/me/explanation. pnpm generate:api produces typed response. | ✅ K-02 |
| Fix share flow UTM + null username | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/assessment/[sessionId]/complete/page.tsx` | Share button disabled until username loads. UTM params added (utm_source=assessment_complete). Both locale files: shareNudge + shareNudgeLow keys added. | ✅ K-03+09 |
| answer_version conflict test | `apps/api/tests/test_smoke_assessment.py` | New test: submit_answer returns 409 CONCURRENT_SUBMIT when optimistic lock fires (data=[]). | ✅ K-04 |
| Onboarding competency redirect | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/onboarding/page.tsx` | handleFinish() now passes selectedCompetency as ?competency= param. Assessment page already reads and pre-selects it. | ✅ K-05 |
| Org auth + owner_id removal | `apps/api/app/routers/organizations.py`, `apps/api/app/schemas/organization.py` | GET /api/organizations and /{org_id} now require CurrentUserId (was unauthenticated). owner_id removed from OrganizationResponse. Generated TS types updated. | ✅ K-06 |
| Session expiry tests | `apps/api/tests/test_smoke_assessment.py` | 2 new tests: submit_answer → 410 SESSION_EXPIRED, complete_assessment → 410 SESSION_EXPIRED. | ✅ K-07 |
| upsert_aura_score error handling | `apps/api/app/routers/assessment.py`, `supabase/migrations/20260330150000_add_pending_aura_sync.sql` | try/except around RPC call. On failure: logs error + sets pending_aura_sync=True on session row. HTTP 200 still returned. Migration adds pending_aura_sync BOOLEAN column + partial index. | ✅ K-08 |
| AURA endpoint rate limit | `apps/api/app/routers/aura.py` | GET /api/aura/{volunteer_id} rate limit changed from RATE_DEFAULT (60/min) to RATE_DISCOVERY (10/min). Prevents enumeration. Kept public for OG card fetches. | ✅ K-10 |
| Public profile zero-AURA state | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(public)/u/[username]/page.tsx` | Clock icon + "Assessment in progress" + description replaces single dim text. i18n keys added to both locales. | ✅ K-11 |
| SENTRY_DSN warning | `apps/api/app/config.py` | validate_production_settings() warns if sentry_dsn is empty. | ✅ K-12a |
| keyword_fallback spike alert | `apps/api/app/core/assessment/bars.py` | Module-level hourly counter. Fires Telegram alert + logger.warning when 10th fallback occurs in current hour. | ✅ K-12b |
| /health uses Depends() | `apps/api/app/routers/health.py` | Replaced inline acreate_client() with SupabaseAdmin dependency. Test updated to mock admin dep. test_security.py updated too. | ✅ K-13 |
| Dashboard share prompt | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` | One-time dismissible banner: "Your AURA profile is live!" shown after first score. Copy link + Telegram share. localStorage-persisted dismiss. i18n in both locales. | ✅ K-14 |
| Per-user daily LLM cap | `apps/api/app/core/assessment/bars.py`, `apps/api/app/routers/assessment.py` | force_degraded param on evaluate_answer(). Cap: 20 open-ended LLM calls/user/day. Over cap → keyword_fallback + reeval queue. Prevents budget drain from adversarial users. | ✅ K-15 |
| Test fixes | `apps/api/tests/test_profiles.py`, `apps/api/tests/test_security.py`, `apps/api/tests/test_subscription.py`, `apps/api/tests/test_health.py` | Mock SupabaseAdmin dep in tests that need it. profile create tests (3) + security headers + subscription unauthenticated (2) + health endpoint. | ✅ fixes |

## Session 76 continued (2026-03-30) — BATCH-C: Paywall + Subscription E2E — 623/623 tests passing

| Code | Location | What it does | Status |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Paywall gate | `apps/api/app/routers/assessment.py` | HTTP 402 SUBSCRIPTION_REQUIRED if subscription_status in ('expired', 'cancelled') on POST /api/assessment/start. Before any session creation. | ✅ SHIPPED |
| `/subscription/success` page | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/subscription/success/page.tsx` | Post-Stripe-checkout success page. Invalidates ['subscription'] + ['profile'] TanStack caches. Shows session_id reference (truncated). | ✅ NEW |
| `/subscription/cancelled` page | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/subscription/cancelled/page.tsx` | Post-Stripe-checkout cancel page. XCircle icon. CTAs: dashboard + settings. | ✅ NEW |
| Leaderboard → aura_scores_public | `apps/api/app/routers/leaderboard.py` | Switched from base aura_scores table to aura_scores_public view (security_barrier=TRUE). Period filter column: updated_at → last_updated. | ✅ FIXED |
| events_no_show removed | `apps/api/app/schemas/discovery.py`, `apps/api/app/routers/discovery.py` | Removed events_no_show from DiscoveryVolunteer. Field excluded from aura_scores_public — keeping it was a latent data-leak vector. | ✅ FIXED |
| stripe_customer_id excluded | `apps/api/app/routers/profiles.py` | GET /profiles/me now uses explicit column list. Excludes stripe_customer_id + stripe_subscription_id. Includes registration_number, registration_tier, subscription_status, trial_ends_at. | ✅ FIXED |
| Webhook race condition fix | `apps/api/app/routers/subscription.py` | _update_profile_subscription returns False on no-match → _handle_subscription_created returns bool → main dispatch raises HTTP 500 → Stripe retries. | ✅ FIXED |
| getattr antipattern removed | `apps/api/app/routers/subscription.py` | Replaced getattr(settings, "stripe_price_id", ...) with direct settings.stripe_price_id access. | ✅ FIXED |
| ESTIMATED_QUESTIONS = 8 | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/assessment/[sessionId]/page.tsx` | Fixed: was 10, actual communication pool size is 8. Progress bar now accurate. | ✅ FIXED |
| Public profile registration badge | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(public)/u/[username]/page.tsx` | PublicProfile interface + JSX: shows #0001 · Founding Member (founding_100) or #0342 · Early Member (founding_1000) badge. | ✅ NEW |
| Risk Manager + Readiness Manager | `packages/swarm/autonomous_run.py`, `memory/swarm/skills/risk-manager.md`, `memory/swarm/skills/readiness-manager.md`, `memory/swarm/agent-roster.md` | Two new permanent agents in PERSPECTIVES. ISO 31000 + Google SRE standards. Their first run found the paywall enforcement gap. | ✅ NEW |
| SESSION-DIFFS.jsonl bootstrap | `memory/swarm/SESSION-DIFFS.jsonl` | Bootstrap entry with all migrations + routes from previous sessions. Agents now have a baseline of shipped work. | ✅ NEW |
| TASK-PROTOCOL v5.1 Step 4.0.5 | `docs/TASK-PROTOCOL.md` | Completion Consensus step now has concrete output format: AGENT/TASKS COMPLETED/TESTS RAN/JOURNEY VERIFIED/MEMORY UPDATED/BLOCKERS/SIGN-OFF per agent. | ✅ UPDATED |
| test_paywall_enforcement.py | `apps/api/tests/test_paywall_enforcement.py` | 6 tests: blocked when expired, blocked when cancelled, allowed when trial, allowed when active, allowed when no profile row, error shape contract. | ✅ NEW |
| test_subscription_status_boundary.py | `apps/api/tests/test_subscription_status_boundary.py` | 5 tests: trial auto-expiry, future trial stays trial, 1-second boundary, no end date, Z-suffix ISO parsing. | ✅ NEW |

## Session 76 (2026-03-30) — Swarm Optimization Batch — 612/612 tests passing

| Code | Location | What it does | Status |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| `session_end_hook.py` | `packages/swarm/session_end_hook.py` | On every push to main: captures git diff → `SESSION-DIFFS.jsonl`, injects RECENTLY SHIPPED block into `shared-context.md`. Closes 42% already-done proposals gap. | ✅ NEW |
| `skills_loader.py` | `packages/swarm/skills_loader.py` | Auto-matches task description against CLAUDE.md Skills Matrix using regex. Returns skill file content for injection into agent prompts. CLI: `--task "description"`. | ✅ NEW |
| `.github/workflows/session-end.yml` | `.github/workflows/session-end.yml` | Two jobs: (1) session-end-hook (captures diff on push), (2) session-mini-swarm (runs code-review mode swarm on changed files). Triggers on push to main for backend/migration/swarm code. | ✅ NEW |
| `autonomous_run.py` — SESSION-DIFFS.jsonl reader | `packages/swarm/autonomous_run.py` | `_read_project_state()` now reads last 3 SESSION-DIFFS.jsonl entries → injects RECENTLY SHIPPED section at top of agent context. Agents see git-level changes, not just static memory files. | ✅ UPDATED |
| `docs/TASK-PROTOCOL.md` v5.1 | `docs/TASK-PROTOCOL.md` | Added: Phase 0.7 (Sprint Gate DSP), Step 4.1.5 (Session-End Mini-Swarm), Step 4.2.5 (Retro Sim), 3 DSP auto-trigger modes (Session Hook/Code Gate/Retro Sim). Version bumped 5.0 → 5.1. | ✅ UPDATED |
| Trial subscription banner + settings section | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`, `settings/page.tsx` | Amber/red trial countdown banner on dashboard (dismissible). Subscription section in settings with plan badge + days remaining. useSubscription hook. 16 i18n keys. | ✅ SHIPPED (BATCH-A) |
| Security hardening tests | `apps/api/tests/test_security_hardening.py` | 15 tests: rapid-restart cooldown (5) + prompt injection detection (8) + false-positive checks (2). All passing. | ✅ SHIPPED (BATCH-A) |
| Subscription router integration tests | `apps/api/tests/test_subscription.py` | 10 tests: GET status×4, checkout×3, webhook×3. All passing. | ✅ SHIPPED (BATCH-A) |
| `supabase/migrations/20260330000001_security_fixes_p0.sql` | Supabase | Crystal ledger idempotency UNIQUE INDEX; rapid-restart cooldown index; revoke avg_aura_score from anon+authenticated. | ✅ MIGRATION READY |
| `supabase/migrations/20260330100000_security_fixes_grants.sql` | Supabase | BrandedBy: REVOKE from authenticated; Notifications: DROP open INSERT policy; CEO inbox: documented intentional default-deny. | ✅ MIGRATION READY |
| `supabase/migrations/20260330110000_seed_questions_remaining_competencies.sql` | Supabase | 5 new MCQ questions for communication competency, IRT b-values -1.1 to 1.3. | ✅ MIGRATION READY |
| `apps/web/src/lib/api/configure-client.ts` | Frontend | SDK auth interceptor: Supabase Bearer token injected via @hey-api/client-fetch interceptors. Fixes unauthenticated generated SDK calls (HIGH security finding). | ✅ SHIPPED |

## Session 75 continued (2026-03-29) — Test suite: 574/574 passing

| Code | Location | What it does | Status |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| BARS fallback chain — add `_try_groq` patches | `tests/test_sprint8_fixes.py`, `tests/test_smoke_assessment.py` | Added `_try_groq` mock to all 3 BARS timeout tests. Groq sits between Gemini and OpenAI in the fallback chain; unpatched it called the real API and prevented OpenAI from being reached. | ✅ FIXED |
| assessment router — `status="in_progress"` for full pipeline | `tests/test_assessment_router.py` | Changed session fixture `status` from `"completed"` to `"in_progress"`. `completed` triggers early-return path (no RPC). Tests asserting `aura_updated=True` require `in_progress`. Admin mock call order corrected: call 1 = gaming UPDATE, call 2 = slug lookup. | ✅ FIXED |
| e2e tests — `app.dependency_overrides` pattern | `tests/test_assessment_api_e2e.py` | Converted all 3 tests from `patch()` to `app.dependency_overrides`. FastAPI captures dep references at import time; `patch()` doesn't intercept them. Fixed `MOCK_QUESTIONS.options` from `list[str]` to `list[dict]` (`{key, text_en, text_az}`). Removed `response=` kwarg from `submit_response()` (param doesn't exist). | ✅ FIXED |
| stats endpoint — RPC mock + rounding | `tests/test_new_endpoints.py`, `app/routers/stats.py` | Stats endpoint uses `db.rpc("avg_aura_score")` not table scan. Mock fixed to return RPC mock. Endpoint now calls `round(float(result.data), 1)`. | ✅ FIXED |
| smoke tests — LLM mocks return `(None, None)` tuples | `tests/test_smoke_assessment.py` | `_try_gemini`/`_try_groq` return `(scores, concept_details)` tuples. Mocking `return_value=None` caused unpacking errors. Fixed to `return_value=(None, None)`. | ✅ FIXED |
| RLS — UPDATE policy for `assessment_sessions` | `supabase/migrations/20260324000015_rls_audit_fixes.sql` | Added missing UPDATE policy "Users can only abandon own sessions" — `USING (auth.uid() = volunteer_id AND status = 'in_progress')`. Test `test_rls_session_update_policy_exists` was checking for this. | ✅ MIGRATION READY |

## Session 75 continued (2026-03-29) — QA Chaos Agent batch: 6 bugs

| Code | Location | What it does | Status |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| BUG-013: visibility filter in search | `apps/api/app/routers/organizations.py` | Added `.eq("visibility","public")` to rule-based aura_scores query + post-filter for semantic RPC path. Hidden/badge_only profiles no longer appear in org volunteer search. | ✅ FIXED |
| BUG-015: complete_assessment early return | `apps/api/app/routers/assessment.py` | Added early return when session status == "completed" — returns stored values without re-running pipeline. Prevents double aura_history append on race condition. | ✅ FIXED |
| BUG-009: retest cooldown .days → total_seconds | `apps/api/app/routers/assessment.py` | 3 locations: cooldown check (line ~124), info endpoint cooldown (line ~740), theta decay (line ~180). `.days` truncated fractional days; now uses `total_seconds() // 86400`. | ✅ FIXED |
| BUG-017: UNIQUE constraint on org owner | `supabase/migrations/20260329120000_organizations_owner_unique.sql` | `ALTER TABLE organizations ADD CONSTRAINT organizations_owner_id_unique UNIQUE (owner_id)`. Prevents duplicate orgs from race condition on simultaneous POST /api/organizations. | ✅ MIGRATION READY |
| BUG-003+014: intro_requests RLS hardening | `supabase/migrations/20260329120001_intro_requests_rls_hardening.sql` | Drops overly broad INSERT (TRUE) and unified UPDATE policies. Replaces with: org INSERT requires uid()=org_id; org UPDATE = withdraw only; volunteer UPDATE = accept/reject from pending only. | ✅ MIGRATION READY |

## Session 75 continued (2026-03-29) — BATCH E tail: Leyla P1 fixes

| Code | Location | What it does | Status |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| `<a>` → `<Link>` in aura empty state | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/aura/page.tsx` | Start assessment button in empty state was `<a>` (full-page reload on mobile). Changed to Next.js `<Link>` for client navigation. | ✅ FIXED |
| Null username guard | `apps/web/src/components/aura/share-buttons.tsx` | `username` prop changed to `string \| null \| undefined`. If null, renders "Set username in Settings to unlock sharing" instead of broken `/u/null` URLs. | ✅ FIXED |
| Assessment infinite spinner recovery | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/assessment/[sessionId]/page.tsx` | Added `isStuck` state + 6s timeout. When `currentQuestion` is null after 6s on the question screen (refresh mid-session), shows recovery button → competency selection instead of infinite spinner. | ✅ FIXED |

## Session 75 (2026-03-29) — BATCH 2026-03-29-E: Simulation + Bug Fix Sprint

| Code | Location | What it does | Status |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Org row auto-creation | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/onboarding/page.tsx` | After profile creation for org accounts, auto-calls `POST /api/organizations` with display_name as org name. 409 silently ignored (idempotent). Fixes B2B launch blocker. | ✅ FIXED |
| .maybe_single() fix | `apps/api/app/routers/organizations.py` | 4 locations changed from `.single()` → `.maybe_single()`: get_my_organization, get_organization, get_org_dashboard, list_org_volunteers, assign_assessments. Prevents 500 errors. | ✅ FIXED |
| Discovery private field fix | `apps/api/app/routers/discovery.py` | Changed from `aura_scores` base table to `aura_scores_public` safe view. Removed `events_no_show` from select. Added `.gt("total_score", 0)` to exclude ghost profiles. | ✅ FIXED |
| AURA badge_only leak fix | `apps/api/app/routers/aura.py` | badge_only path now strips ALL private fields explicitly (last_updated, events_*, reliability_*) before constructing response. | ✅ FIXED |
| MCQ scoring fix | `apps/api/app/routers/assessment.py` | Case-insensitive comparison (.strip().lower() on both sides). Logger.warning when MCQ has no correct_answer. | ✅ FIXED |
| Double UPDATE fix | `apps/api/app/routers/assessment.py` | complete_assessment: merged gaming columns into single UPDATE for in_progress sessions. Eliminates race condition. | ✅ FIXED |
| Session expiry enforcement | `apps/api/app/routers/assessment.py` | expires_at checked in submit_answer AND complete_assessment. Returns 410 SESSION_EXPIRED. | ✅ FIXED |
| Signup org pre-select | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(auth)/signup/page.tsx` | `?type=organization` query param pre-selects org account type. useSearchParams added. | ✅ FIXED |
| Privacy consent error text | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(auth)/signup/page.tsx` | Separate i18n key `auth.privacyConsentRequired` for validation error vs consent label. | ✅ FIXED |
| Password hint inline | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(auth)/signup/page.tsx` | Inline hint below password field: "8+ characters, uppercase, lowercase, and a number." | ✅ FIXED |
| display_name required | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/onboarding/page.tsx` | step1Valid now requires display_name.trim().length >= 1. | ✅ FIXED |
| POST 404 fix | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/onboarding/page.tsx` | Removed `&& res.status !== 404` — POST 404 is now treated as a real error. | ✅ FIXED |
| Org CTA routing fix | `apps/web/src/components/landing/hero-section.tsx` | "Find talent" button routes to `signup?type=organization` instead of generic signup. | ✅ FIXED |
| Post-AURA share prompt | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/aura/page.tsx` | Modal fires 3s after first AURA reveal. sessionStorage prevents repeat fires. Uses AnimatePresence + spring animation. | ✅ SHIPPED |
| Invite page | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(public)/invite/page.tsx` | Beta invite landing page with code allowlist (BETA_01-30, ORG_01-05, OPEN). Pre-selects org/volunteer type. 3s countdown auto-redirect to signup. Replaces waitlist mechanic. | ✅ SHIPPED |
| LinkedIn DAY 7 CTA | `docs/content/LINKEDIN-SERIES-CLAUDE-CTO.md` | "If you want to be in the first 50 → volaura.app/invite" added before P.S. UTM URL noted for Yusif. | ✅ UPDATED |
