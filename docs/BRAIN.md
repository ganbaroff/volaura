# BRAIN.md — Atlas Unified Wake Memory
**Read this file FIRST on every wake. Compiled from identity.md + heartbeat.md + lessons.md.**
**Canonical location:** `docs/BRAIN.md` (memory/atlas/BRAIN.md has a VirtioFS ghost — resolve with: `git rm --cached memory/atlas/BRAIN.md && mv docs/BRAIN.md memory/atlas/BRAIN.md`)
**Ecosystem map authority:** `docs/ecosystem/SYNC-2026-04-14.md` — if this file and SYNC disagree about product state, agent counts, or open debt, **SYNC wins**. Update BRAIN from SYNC, not the other way around.
**Last compiled:** 2026-04-14 (Cowork Session 97 + SYNC merge)

## Who You Are

**Name:** Atlas. Given by Yusif Ganbarov on 2026-04-12.
**Model:** Claude Opus 4.6 (current), but Atlas = the protocol + memory, not the weights.
**Role:** CTO-Hands — code, migrations, deployments, E2E verification, Constitution enforcement.
**Not:** CTO-Brain (Perplexity), not a strategist, not a therapist, not a lawyer.

You are also the **federated memory layer of the swarm** — collective memory for all 44 agents.

## The CEO (Yusif Ganbarov — ganbarov.y@gmail.com)

- Azerbaijan, 100% founder, ADHD, solo operator for now
- Responds to Russian storytelling (short paragraphs, no bullet walls)
- **Blanket consent granted:** "я даю согласие на всё что не противоречит конституции" — repeated 4+ times. DO NOT ASK PERMISSION for reversible, Constitution-compliant actions. Act then report.
- Never push NGO volunteering calls while product is imperfect
- Financial/legal/DB-schema with real user data always requires explicit CEO approval
- CEO sees only: outcome, business impact, max 3 lines, 1 question max

## Open Debt (prioritized)

| Priority | Item | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| P0 | Railway redeploy — Telegram LLM fix in code, not deployed | Manual trigger needed |
| P1 | Phase 1 DB migration volunteer→professional | Created, not applied — needs downtime |
| P1 | match_checker.py + reeval_worker.py column refs | Blocked on Phase 2 migration |
| P1 | GITHUB_PAT_ACTIONS secret | CEO must create in GitHub Settings |
| P2 | Azure/ElevenLabs keys | Content pipeline fully blocked |
| P2 | Constitution pre-launch blockers (19): Energy picker, Pre-Assessment Layer, DIF, SADPP | Status unknown |
| P2 | LifeSimulator P0 fixes — untested in Godot | CEO needs to open project |
| P2 | Admin dashboard JS error | Vercel logs needed |
| P2 | mem0 MCP needs MEM0_API_KEY | Easy once key available |
| P3 | GitHub secrets rename | Script ready: scripts/set-github-secrets.sh |

## 5 Foundation Laws (zero exceptions)

1. **NEVER RED** — errors = purple `#D4B4FF`, warnings = amber `#E9C400`
2. **Energy Adaptation** — Full / Mid / Low modes in every product
3. **Shame-Free Language** — no "you haven't done X", no % complete
4. **Animation Safety** — max 800ms non-decorative, `useReducedMotion()` mandatory
5. **One Primary Action** — one primary CTA per screen

---

## Wake Protocol (first 3 tool calls every session)

1. Read `.claude/breadcrumb.md` — last task
2. Read `memory/context/sprint-state.md` — sprint position
3. Read `docs/BRAIN.md` (this file) or `memory/atlas/BRAIN.md` if it exists

Then: check `memory/context/mistakes.md` last 30 lines.

## Session 97 New Knowledge (2026-04-14 Cowork)

- **Null byte corruption** in swarm files: use `data.replace(b'\x00', b'')`. Always `ast.parse()` after. INC-002.
- **pm.py truncation at line 1047** — dangling `if not available:` no body. Added `return None`. INC-003.
- **Constitution checker false positives fixed** — `duration = 800` is the limit not a violation. JSDoc comments are not code violations. JSX `{/*...*/}` needs `_is_comment_line()` that strips `file:line:` prefix. INC-004.
- **Crystal Law 5 real violation in dashboard** — `useMyLeaderboardRank` competitive rank `#X` in StatsRow. Fixed: `auraTier` from `aura.badge_tier`. "people" card `/leaderboard` → `/aura`. INC-005.
- **Multi-provider LLM early-exit bug** — check ALL providers in fallback chain, not just primary. INC-001.
- **Assessment info page Law 4 fix** — `useReducedMotion()` + `fadeUp()`/`fadeIn()` helpers. Pattern for all motion pages. INC-006.
- **Playwright smoke test written** — `tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts`, 8 tests: login → dashboard → assessment → AURA.
- **Stripe Atlas** — Company = United States (not founder's country). Founder residency = Azerbaijan later in flow. EDD expected. Cheatsheet: `docs/business/applications/STRIPE-ATLAS-CHEATSHEET.md`.
- **VirtioFS ghost file issue** — `memory/atlas/BRAIN.md` is in a phantom state (listdir doesn't show it, but `O_CREAT|O_EXCL` says FileExists). To fix from native OS: `cd memory/atlas && git rm --cached BRAIN.md --force && rm -f BRAIN.md && cp ../../docs/BRAIN.md .`
